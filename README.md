# personality-system-K-means

Personality is a combination of a person's characteristics and attitudes in dealing
with different social situations as in kindergarten, school, university, family, work
team, etc.
There is a great effect of personality on the learning capabilities of humans. For instance, in learning performance, we may see significant differences between persons who belong to
extroverts and the ones belonging to introverts.
I have used this project's unsupervised learning algorithm, K-means, to divide people into Ten distinct personality types.
I have built personality systems (example: MBTI,Enneagram) these are some of the existing personality systems, MBTI divides people into 16 personality types and ENNEAGRAM divides people into nine personality types but would like to pick up my won number so I have divided them into ten personality types
1st
I have downloaded 1 million responses to 250 personality quotations from big five personality tests from Kaggle.
2nd
I have fed the data into a machine learning Algorithm. 3rd
I have plotted my results to see what personality types are in our data.
